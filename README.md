# UC-Davis-Medfly-Data-Exploration

This R Shiny Dashboard allowed our research team led by world renowned statistician Dr. Hans Georg Mueller to visualize the hazard functions of male and female medfly cage populations. With this app that I created our research team was able to detect a source of variation that warranted a future formal Functional Principal Component Analysis. Included is the global workspace that contains the necessary data elements to run the app.
